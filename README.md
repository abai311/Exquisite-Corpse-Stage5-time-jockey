## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*When i thought about time i thought of old film reels showing a galloping horse in motion, and as well as seeing the passage of time through destruction and degradation so i decided to combine the two. i kind of went for a 'crazy doomsday timer' aesthetic, and allowed the viewer to 'begin time' through their own interaction with the program. I used a combination of fund images from google for the horses, and photos of photos in a magazine i found on my computer of a collapsing building, and then set up a seconds counter for the doomsday vibe. i was aiming for the feeling of running through time lightheartedly despite the decay of the world as time passes on. *

*Hearing Interactivity, I'm reminded of all the images and information shown to me throughout my day.  A lot of the information I don't want to see, but it is hard not to be forced to see images and ads everywhere.  I thought of the OVERACTIVITY of all the images on random.  We are overloaded with ideas, images, and information every few seconds in life.*

*Right away I knew that I wanted to carry on and build on the idea of over interactivity and show the amount of content we are exposed to everyday, through social media and the internet in general. The checkbox represents the act of clicking online, so once itâ€™s clicked everything pops up onto the screen. I loved the randomness of the different mixes of images so I kept them and changed their opacity so they blended together as a background. I used a few different APIs to draw data from, drew them to the canvas, overlapping to create a confusing list of words and numbers. I also made a CSV file with some random data to create two line graphs adding to the show of data on the screen.
I kept the horse images and the minute counter, to continue the underlying theme of time passing, and to represent how much time can be lost while scrolling or surfing the internet.
I wanted to get across how overwhelming it can feel being online in this day and age. And how we are often bombarded with information, ads and content that we don't necessarily want to see or are interested in.*

I created a word game about explorers, you can enter different branch plots according to the options you choose, and finally find your way home, every time you enter a new scene, it will show a photo of the current scene, I used CogView AI painting, according to the scene description I entered, I drew the corresponding picture, with the help of chatgpt I learned how to implement the multi-button function trigger like this word game, You can determine which option you are clicking by judging the position of the mouse when you click, and you don't need to bind a function to each button, and each button can use an anonymous function to achieve the corresponding function when it is created.

For this stage I wanted to to use some simple skills that we had learnt in earlier workshops to add a living entity to Ruiting's stage 4 sketch. I also wanted to keep the theme of this entire assignment intact so I thought to create flowers and their different stages to bloom. However, while working on it I was struggling to create every stage of transformation. So I thought to create just the bud of a flower and a flower in bloom. I wanted to capture the "fullstops" in life and there could be no in between; perhaps evoke the question "what if there was no in between?" 

While trying to create shapes to finally create the flowers, I was looking at different ways of doing it. I came across another P5js sketch that was exactly what I had in mind but all the flowers had already bloomed. I used that sketch as a skeleton to create what I wanted. I changed values that resulted in changing colours, stages of transformation, and the frameCount. Changing these values also let me create different kinds of flowers - not all of them are the same. The original sketch that mine is adapted from did not loop either so I had to change that around but I was only able to do that after I added my sketch to Ruiting's. I wanted to make the flowers loop everytime a button was clicked in her game which it does and everytime the process of growth is over. Unfortunately, it also loops when you click anywhere on the screen and when the process of growth is complete the flowers go back to look the way they did in the original sketch. I was unsuccessful in changing that but overall the sketch does show what I intended it to; the line of different flowers at limited stages of growth in the middle of the game. The flowers only show thier beginning and end but are placed in the middle ("in between") of the game.
